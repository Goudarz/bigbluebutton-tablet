# BigBlueButton Tablet

BigBlueButton app for tablets. It allows you to share your screen in a BigBlueButton room, and also provides improved background audio.

PS: This runs on mobile too, but it's mainly targeted for tablets, as it requires good CPU due to usage of a webview for rendering BigBlueButton.
